<h1>About Panera Bread</h1>
</header>

<section>
<h2>Our Origins</h2>
<p>
Panera Bread began in 1987 as a small community bakery under the name <strong>St. Louis Bread Company</strong>, founded with a secret sourdough starter from San Francisco and a belief that the best part of bread is sharing it.
</p>

<h2>Continuing to Evolve — “The New Era”</h2>
<p>
In 2024, Panera launched its biggest menu overhaul yet: more than 20 new and enhanced offerings, focusing on what guests love most — soups, salads, sandwiches, mac & cheese, bakery items, and coffee & drinks.
</p>
<p>
The revamp reflects our commitment to fresh ideas, quality ingredients, variety, and value — staying true to our roots while evolving to meet modern tastes and lifestyles.

<h2>Our Promise</h2>
<p>
At Panera Bread, we believe nothing beats breaking bread together. Whether it’s a quick lunch, a cozy breakfast, or a gathering with friends, we’re committed to serving food that feels good in the moment — and long after.
